# Friends Forever 🌟

**Friends Forever** is a social media platform designed to nurture meaningful friendships. It's a space where you can:  

- Add friends and exchange **precious notes**  
- Share heartfelt **apology messages** when things go wrong  
- Give your friends a **bump** if you haven’t talked in a while  

This project is built using **Flutter** for the frontend and **ServerPod** for the backend. It’s a part of my *build in public* journey to showcase my Flutter skills, explore best practices, and learn new technologies.
